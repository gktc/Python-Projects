## 🧩 Project Overview

This project recreates a classic **Ping Pong (Pong)** game using Python’s built-in `turtle` graphics.  
It includes a ball, two paddles, and a scoreboard — everything drawn with simple graphics primitives.

🎯 **Goal:** Don’t let the ball pass your paddle!  
Every time the opponent misses, you score a point.
