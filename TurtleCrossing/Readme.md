## 🧩 Project Overview

This project recreates the classic **Turtle Crossing** game using Python’s built-in `turtle` graphics library.  
You control a turtle trying to cross the busy road while avoiding cars that zoom by.  
With every successful crossing, the game level increases — and so does the car speed! 🐢⚡

🎯 **Goal:**  
Reach the top of the screen without getting hit by a car. Each crossing increases your level and car speed.
